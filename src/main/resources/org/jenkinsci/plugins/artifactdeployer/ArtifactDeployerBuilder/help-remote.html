        The artifacts will be deployed in the specified output directory.<br/>
        The remote location must be accessible through the build machine (master/slave node).<br/>
        If you want to have the ability to download deployed artifacts through the Jenkins dashboard,
        the location must be accessible from the Jenkins master.
        For example, '/nfs/build/deploy/${BUILD_ID}' can be valid value.
